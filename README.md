## Technologies/Frameworks Used
### Front-end
- Angular
- Bootstrap (for styling only)

### Back-end
- Java
- Spring boot
    - Web
    - Data (JPA)
- Lombok
- AWS RDS (postgres)
- AWS s3 buckets to store images
- H2 to test back-end service layer

## How to use this repo?
### Front-end
- The front-end has been seperated in the `UI` folder. 
- Simply install the necessary dependencies in your local environment and `ng serve` to fire up the angular app.

### Back-end
- The POM.xml (project) is on the root directory.
- You must make some adjustments to `application.properties`. Simply change the aws credentials to access 

```properties
server.port=9003 
<!-- User can change the port, default is 8080 -->

spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB

#PSQL CONfig
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Everytime we change then the table will be updated, none would not run and .sql files
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
spring.jpa.hibernate.show.sql=true

# this is our connection to the databse
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://**<your AWS RDS database>**
spring.datasource.username=**<your AWS RDS database username, it is mostly postgres> **
spring.datasource.password=**<your AWS RDS database password>**
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=never

logging.level.org.springframework.context=DEBUG
``` 
- You must also make some adjustments to `AmazonConfig` in utility package
```java
@Configuration
public class AmazonConfig {

    @Bean //spring instantiates this at runtime.
    public AmazonS3 s3() {
        AWSCredentials awsCredentials = new BasicAWSCredentials("<insert your access ID>", "<insert your secret key>");
        return AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard().withRegion("<insert-aws-region>") // like "us-east-1"
                .withCredentials(new AWSStaticCredentialsProvider(awsCredentials)).build();
    }
}
```
- You must also make some changes in the `BucketName` class and change `PROFILE_IMAGE` and insert your s3 bucket name
```Java
package com.revature.project_p2.utility;

public enum BucketName {
    PROFILE_IMAGE("<your bucket name here>");

    private final String bucketName;

    BucketName(String bucketName) {
        this.bucketName = bucketName;
    }

    public String getBucketName() {
        return bucketName;
    }
}

```
- For best user experience, the dimensions of the user images should not exceed 300px by 300px
